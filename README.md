Project includes a README file that explains the following:

A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is

Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements

If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project

The readme should be called readme.md or readme.txt and located in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project on GitHub

Choose at least 1 item on the CSS Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 item off the list of JavaScript Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 additional item from any of the lists below and implement it in your project

We recommend you pick a 4th item (or more!) to add, just in case something goes wrong with one of your other items - 3 is only the minimum requirement
===========================================================================
I wanted to create a volunteer webpage that made it easy to volunteer for projects. The idea came from a church event. We wanted to create a meal plan, but several websites that I saw were not very helpful.
One of the first things I did was create a static page using basic HTML5 and CSS3. It was fun. 

=================JavaScript=====================
I added a carousel for fun and to meet the animation requirement.
I also wanted to try my hand at the DOM and JS, so I added a way to change the color of the main heading.
I had fun adding the tic-tac-toe board, as it was by far the greatest JavaScript challenge. 
The game really showed me how far I needed to go in JS.
The to-do list features JavaScript again. It was challenging as was the game, and the mentors really came in clutch here.
=================CSS=====================
As for CSS, I decorated the buttons so that it had contrast. 
Originally, the page was to be smokey with a lot of greys however it did not have enough contrast.  I changed a few of the paragraph's color to blue. 
The link for tic-tac-toe was changed to blue, but different than the 'show date' button. 
Display: flex was used throughout. 
There are 4 media queries, starting with the cell phone width. What the they modify is the form field.
=================HTML=====================
The structure is straightforward and entirely within flexbox using the CSS feature display:flex.

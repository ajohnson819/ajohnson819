Project includes a README file that explains the following:

A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is

Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements

If needed, any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project

The readme should be called readme.md or readme.txt and located in the top level of your project folder so that GitHub automatically displays it when viewing your project on GitHub

Choose at least 1 item on the CSS Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 item off the list of JavaScript Features List below and implement it in your project
Choose at least 1 additional item from any of the lists below and implement it in your project

We recommend you pick a 4th item (or more!) to add, just in case something goes wrong with one of your other items - 3 is only the minimum requirement

I wanted to create a volunteer webpage that made it easy to volunteer for projects. The idea came from a church event. We wanted to create a meal plan, but several websites that I saw were not very helpful.
One of the first things I did was create a static page using basic HTML5 and CSS3. It was fun.
